# project2020

In this project, I will perform comparisons and display a variety of data analytics regarding India. 
Such comparisons will include whether there is any signifcant correlation of India’s health and poverty indicators,
to the growing science and technology industry, energy and mining industry, and potentially, 
how social protection and labor factor into these indicators.

Data sets are sourced from the Humanitarian Data Exchange via Data.World. 
I wish to address what effects industry (science and technology, energy and mining) 
has had on the health and poverty indictors of India. Has industrialization growth helped or hindered 
the societal plight—improving general health of the people and reducing poverty, or, perhaps, 
closing the wealth gap at the cost of national health?
